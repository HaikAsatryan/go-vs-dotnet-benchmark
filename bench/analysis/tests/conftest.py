"""Analysis-suite fixtures.

The analysis modules depend on the scientific stack (numpy/scipy/pandas), which
`uv sync` installs. In the unusual case that it is absent, these test modules
must not even be COLLECTED, because they
import numpy at module top level and collection happens before any skip marker
can run. `collect_ignore_glob` drops them entirely with a visible reason; with
the stack installed they collect and run normally. Run `uv sync --extra analysis`
to enable them.
