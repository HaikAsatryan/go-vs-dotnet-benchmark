"""Isotonic regression via the Pool-Adjacent-Violators Algorithm (PAVA).

In-repo, ~20 lines on numpy, NO sklearn: the relationship
p99(rate) is monotone non-decreasing physically but not a known parametric form,
so we fit with the constraint that is EXACTLY true (monotonicity) and nothing
more. Isotonic regression is non-parametric and robust at the high-variance knee.

`isotonic_fit(y, w)` returns the monotone-non-decreasing least-squares fit g
minimizing sum w_i (y_i - g_i)^2 subject to g_1 <= g_2 <= ... <= g_n. Inputs are
assumed already sorted by the independent variable (rate). Weights default to 1.
