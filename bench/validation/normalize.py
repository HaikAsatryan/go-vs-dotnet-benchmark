"""Canonical JSON normalization for cross-service equivalence.

The single job of this module: turn a parsed JSON response body into a
*canonical* form such that two byte-different-but-semantically-identical bodies
(Go vs .NET) compare equal, WITHOUT masking any difference that actually
matters. Frozen rules, derived from spec/openapi.yaml + spec/cache.md +
spec/db-access.md:

  R1  Object keys sorted recursively. JSON object key order is insignificant on
      both wires (spec/openapi.yaml: "field ORDER ... is irrelevant" for logs;
      JSON objects are unordered), so we canonicalize by sorting.

  R2  Arrays are ORDER-SIGNIFICANT and preserved as-is. Every array in the wire
      contract is explicitly ordered: invoice.items ORDER BY id ASC,
      InvoiceListPage.items ORDER BY id DESC, QuoteResponse.lines input order,
      Problem.errors[field] is a frozen message list. We NEVER reorder arrays;
      a reorder is a real divergence and must fail.

  R3  request_id is excluded. Per spec it is NEVER in a response body (header
      only) and is explicitly "excluded from equivalence". We strip it defensively
      at any depth in case a service leaks it.

  R4  Server-generated, non-deterministic timestamps are normalized to a
      placeholder ONLY where the spec marks them non-deterministic: created_at on
      a FRESHLY CREATED invoice (POST /invoices), whose value is now() at write
      time and cannot match across two independent service processes. For a
      SEEDED invoice read back via GET, created_at IS deterministic across
      services on the same DB load (spec/db-access.md seeder note) and is compared
      structurally. The caller selects the mode via `created_at_mode`.

  R5  Money/ids are integers (int64 minor units) everywhere. We ASSERT no float
      appears on a money/amount/total/price/balance path: a float there is a
      contract violation (spec/openapi.yaml "no floats in money paths"). A bool is
      not an int for this purpose (Python bool is an int subclass; we reject it on
      money paths too).

  R6  Timestamp FORMAT is validated where a timestamp is structurally compared:
      RFC3339 UTC, EXACTLY 6 fractional digits, 'Z' suffix (spec/openapi.yaml).
      Go must not trim trailing zeros; .NET must not emit 7 digits. A malformed
      timestamp raises, so a format regression on either side fails the suite.

This module is pure (no I/O, no Docker, no services) and fully unit-tested.
