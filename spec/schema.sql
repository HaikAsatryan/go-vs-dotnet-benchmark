-- spec/schema.sql
-- Canonical DDL for Ledgerline. Consumed VERBATIM by: sqlc (Go), the EF model
-- assertion tests (.NET), the seeder, and the equivalence harness.
-- Money: bigint minor units end-to-end. Time: timestamptz. PostgreSQL 18.4.
--
-- ID GENERATION (frozen):
--   customers.id      app-assigned (seeder writes explicit ids 1..N; dense
--                     keyspace required for deterministic Zipf selection).
--   invoices.id       GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY. POST /invoices returns the
--                     new id via INSERT ... RETURNING id: one-round-trip id
--                     allocation on BOTH stacks (pgx RETURNING in the batch;
--                     EF SaveChanges reads the key back in the same batched
--                     round-trip). App-generated ids rejected: id-generation
--                     cost would differ in kind between languages.
--   invoice_items.id  GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (never returned/queried).
--
-- Seeder note: COPY may write explicit ids into IDENTITY columns; after COPY
-- the seeder must run, for each identity:
--   ALTER TABLE invoices      ALTER COLUMN id RESTART WITH <seeded_max+1>;
--   ALTER TABLE invoice_items ALTER COLUMN id RESTART WITH <seeded_max+1>;
-- Without the restart, runtime POSTs collide with seeded ids.

--     (customer_id, id DESC) makes it a pure backward index range scan, no
