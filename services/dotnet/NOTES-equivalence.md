# services/dotnet: equivalence contract (.NET emits, Go aligns)

This file documents what the .NET SUT ACTUALLY emits on the wire, captured from a real running
instance via WebApplicationFactory (`ValidationBodyCaptureTests`). The .NET source-gen validation
output is the canonical 400 errors-map shape; the Go service matches it byte-for-byte. All strings
below are copied from captured HTTP responses, not hand-written.

## 400 validation envelope (RFC 7807, application/problem+json)

Frozen top-level fields (x-error-strings.validation), byte-exact:

```json
{
  "type": "https://ledgerline.test/problems/validation",
  "title": "Validation failed",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The request payload failed validation.",
  "errors": { ... }
}
```

No `traceId`/`requestId`/`instance` extensions (stripped in ProblemDetailsConfig). Content-Type is
`application/problem+json`.

## errors-map KEY format (THE alignment target for Go)

Keys are **PascalCase CLR property names**, NOT the snake_case JSON names. Collection elements use
**`Items[i].Property`** indexing (zero-based). This is the native output of .NET 10
`AddValidation()` source-gen; it keys by the validation path built from CLR member names.

Captured example: POST /invoices with `customer_id=0, currency="us", status="closed"`, an items
array of length 2 whose `items[0]` is fully invalid:

```json
"errors": {
  "CustomerId": ["must be a positive integer"],
  "Currency": ["must match ^[A-Z]{3}$"],
  "Status": ["must be one of: draft, open"],
  "Items": ["must contain between 3 and 8 items"],
  "Items[0].Sku": ["must match ^[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{4}$"],
  "Items[0].Description": ["is required"],
  "Items[0].Qty": ["must be between 1 and 1000"],
  "Items[0].UnitPriceMinor": ["must be between 0 and 100000000"]
}
```

Captured example: POST /pricing/quote with `currency="usd"`, 50 items, `items[0].qty=0`,
`items[2].sku="bad-sku"`:

```json
"errors": {
  "Currency": ["must match ^[A-Z]{3}$"],
  "Items[0].Qty": ["must be between 1 and 1000"],
  "Items[2].Sku": ["must match ^[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{4}$"]
}
```

### Key → field mapping (CLR property ↔ wire JSON field)

| errors key (emitted) | wire JSON field | rule |
|---|---|---|
| `CustomerId` | `customer_id` | id_positive |
| `Currency` | `currency` | currency_pattern |
| `Status` | `status` | status_enum |
| `Items` | `items` | items_create_count / items_quote_count |
| `Items[i].Sku` | `items[i].sku` | sku_pattern |
| `Items[i].Description` | `items[i].description` | description_length / required |
| `Items[i].Qty` | `items[i].qty` | qty_range |
| `Items[i].UnitPriceMinor` | `items[i].unit_price_minor` | unit_price_range |

The Go service emits the same keys: `CustomerId`, `Currency`, `Status`, `Items`,
`Items[<i>].Sku`, `Items[<i>].Description`, `Items[<i>].Qty`, `Items[<i>].UnitPriceMinor`. The
index is zero-based, formatted `Items[0]`, `Items[2]`, etc.

### Manual-path keys (not source-gen)

Endpoints that validate path/query params by hand emit lowercase single-token keys (no CLR member
behind them):

| endpoint | condition | key | value |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET /invoices/{id}, POST /invoices/{id}/pdf-stub | id non-integer or `< 1` | `id` | `must be a positive integer` |
| GET /customers/{id}/invoices | id non-integer or `< 1` | `id` | `must be a positive integer` |
| GET /customers/{id}/invoices | page `< 1` | `page` | `must be >= 1` |
| GET /customers/{id}/invoices | page `> 100000` | `page` | `must be <= 100000` |

## errors-map VALUE strings (frozen x-validation-messages, verified on wire)

These EXACT strings are emitted (the regex ones required brace-doubling in the C# attribute so
string.Format leaves them literal: see NOTES.md):

| rule | emitted value |
|---|---|
| required | `is required` |
| sku_pattern | `must match ^[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{4}$` |
| currency_pattern | `must match ^[A-Z]{3}$` |
| status_enum | `must be one of: draft, open` |
| qty_range | `must be between 1 and 1000` |
| unit_price_range | `must be between 0 and 100000000` |
| items_create_count | `must contain between 3 and 8 items` |
| items_quote_count | `must contain exactly 50 items` |
| description_length | `must be between 1 and 200 characters` |
| page_min | `must be >= 1` |
| page_max | `must be <= 100000` |
| id_positive | `must be a positive integer` |

## Content-Type (alignment)

- Every JSON SUCCESS body is emitted with `application/json; charset=utf-8` on BOTH sides
  (ASP.NET's default for JSON results; Go sets the same constant). Problem responses are
  `application/problem+json` (no charset) on both.
- POST request bodies must DECLARE a JSON content type. The gate grammar is FROZEN and
  implemented as the same trivial code on both sides (`MediaTypeGateMiddleware.IsJsonMediaType`
  / Go `isJSONMediaType`): value up to the first `;`, space/tab-trimmed, lowercased, equals
  `application/json` or ends `+json` with a `/`; parameters never validated. The gate runs
  only when the request HAS a body (declared non-zero length, or chunked); a body-less POST
  falls through to binding → the frozen 400. (.NET's native binding would 415 silently and
  with a subtly different grammar, which is WHY the explicit middleware exists.)

## 415 envelope (no errors map)

```json
{ "type":"https://ledgerline.test/problems/unsupported-media-type", "title":"Unsupported media type",
  "status":415, "detail":"The request content type must be application/json." }
```

Logged as one `request_error` (status 415, error_class "validation") plus the access line;
NOT counted in `endpoint_calls`. Both sides gate in their own code before the handler.

## 413 envelope (no errors map; NO request_error)

```json
{ "type":"https://ledgerline.test/problems/payload-too-large", "title":"Payload too large",
  "status":413, "detail":"The request body exceeds the configured limit." }
```

A body over BODY_MAX_BYTES. Access line only: Kestrel enforces the limit below the point
where the app can log a rejection event, so BOTH sides pin the access-line-only shape
(spec/logging.md). Go detects `http.MaxBytesError`; .NET's envelope comes from the
StatusCodePages path via the ProblemDetails 413 mapping.

## endpoint_calls semantics (alignment)

On the two body-decoding POSTs, the counter increments AFTER content-type/decode/field
validation on both sides ("valid requests"). On GET/pdf-stub routes it increments before id
parsing ("routed requests") on both sides.

## GET /customers/{id}/invoices: aggregated 400

When BOTH the path id and ?page are invalid, one errors map carries both keys
(`{"id":[...],"page":[...]}`), both sides. `page` is read from the FIRST query value
(repeated `?page=` params are not comma-joined); `X-Request-Id` likewise takes the first
header value.

## /readyz

200 `{"status":"ok"}` / 503 `{"status":"unavailable"}` on both sides; DB probed first,
Redis only if the DB is reachable. Only "ok" is spec-frozen; "unavailable" is the aligned
failure string.

## 404 / 500 envelopes (no errors map)

```json
{ "type":"https://ledgerline.test/problems/not-found", "title":"Not found",
  "status":404, "detail":"The requested resource does not exist." }
```
```json
{ "type":"https://ledgerline.test/problems/internal", "title":"Internal server error",
  "status":500, "detail":"An unexpected error occurred." }
```

## Success bodies: snake_case, integer minor units, 6-frac timestamps

- All money fields are bare JSON integers (int64); no floats, no decimal points.
- `created_at` is RFC3339 UTC with EXACTLY 6 fractional digits + `Z` (custom format defeats .NET's
  7-digit 'O'). Example: `2026-06-06T00:00:00.000000Z`.
- /pricing/quote 200 body keys verified on wire: `currency`, `lines[]`
  (`sku, category, qty, unit_price_minor, category_surcharge_minor, qty_discount_minor,
  line_total_minor`), `subtotal_minor`, `order_discount_minor`, `total_minor`: all snake_case.
- /healthz 200 body is exactly `{"status":"ok"}` (verified).

## request_id

Accepted from inbound `X-Request-Id` else a server-generated UUIDv4; echoed in the `X-Request-Id`
RESPONSE HEADER only; never in any response body; excluded from JSON equivalence.

## Create-response InvoiceItem ids (resolved 2026-06-06)

All three stacks return the REAL DB identity ids in the 201 body:
spec/db-access.sql `InsertInvoiceItem` is now `:one ... RETURNING id`; the Go
SendBatch and the raw ADO.NET NpgsqlBatch read the N returned ids; efcore gets them
from SaveChanges as before. The cross-service equivalence normalizer still
placeholders server-generated ids/timestamps on create responses (different DB
sequence states between paired calls).

## Wire-level divergences kept + disclosed (2026-08-14 adversarial review)

Found by the pre-run-2 review (real-Kestrel probing + live EF SQL capture);
each is either framework-idiomatic on both sides or outside the frozen
workload, so it is pinned and disclosed rather than "fixed" into
non-idiomatic code.

- **EF Q3 `LIMIT $n` / Q1 `LIMIT 1`**: see spec/db-access.md (pinned by
  EfQueryShapeTests, which capture against the PRODUCTION compiled model).
- **sqlc comment headers on the wire**: Go's generated queries (`Q7
  CustomerExists`, `Q3 ListInvoicesByCustomer`, `Q3b` empty-page check) ship
  with their `-- name: X :one` annotation line; all three .NET layers send the
  bare statement body. Comments are dropped at parse; plans and
  pg_stat_statements queryids are unaffected. Tooling that joins statements
  across languages BY TEXT must strip comments first.
- **BEGIN transport**: Npgsql prepends `BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ
  COMMITTED` to the first command of a tx (no extra round trip); pgx sends a
  bare `begin` as its own round trip. Isolation is identical (server-default
  read committed). Create-path round trips: Go 5 == EF 5 (headline pair
  equal); ado/dapper 4; the variants get one fewer round trip, a .NET driver
  idiom that belongs to their "no-ORM floor" framing.
- **Connection hold**: ado/dapper run the Q7 probe and the tx on ONE held
  connection; EF and Go both check out twice (probe, then tx). Statement and
  round-trip ledgers are unaffected; pool-hold profiles differ slightly.
- **Client abort (load-generator timeout)**: .NET's ExceptionHandlerMiddleware
  converts an in-flight cancellation into status 499 with NO error lines and
  no body; Go's handlers surface it as an internal error: `request_error` +
  `exception` lines through the blocking log queue plus a 500 problem body
  written to the dead socket, and the access line records 500 vs .NET's 499.
  Both sides DO cancel the in-flight DB work. Bounded exposure: sub-knee abort
  rates are ~0 (measured: 7 non-2xx in 358.7M requests) and any probe with
  error rate > 0.1% is excluded from fits by the pre-registered gate, which is
  what happens at the ladder walls.
- **Response framing**: .NET's JSON-writer paths emit `Transfer-Encoding:
  chunked` (including the 15-byte /healthz body) while its `Results.Bytes`
  paths (GET /invoices/{id}, /runtime-stats) set `Content-Length`; Go's
  net/http sets `Content-Length` when a handler returns ≤ 2048 buffered bytes
  and chunks above. Body bytes are identical; framing and a few dozen wire
  bytes differ per endpoint and size.
- **Out-of-workload surface NOT aligned** (framework defaults; the frozen
  workload never exercises them): unmatched 404 (.NET problem+json vs Go
  text/plain), 405 (.NET maps the internal-error strings with status 405 and
  `Allow: GET`; Go plain text with `Allow: GET, HEAD`), HEAD (Go serves it on
  GET routes; .NET 405s), trailing slash (`/invoices/1/` matches on .NET,
  404s on Go), 413 connection semantics (.NET sends `Connection: close`; Go's
  MaxBytesReader close signal is defeated by the statusRecorder wrapper so
  small overshoots keep the connection; status-line reason phrases differ).
- **Redis client behavior**: go-redis v9 retries commands up to 3x on
  transient network errors (its default); SE.Redis never retries commands.
  Client-side timeouts are unpinned (go-redis 3s read vs SE.Redis 5s async).
  Go passes the request context into cache calls; the .NET cache calls take no
  CancellationToken (differs only for already-aborted requests). A healthy
  local Redis exercises none of this.
- **Config parsing (aligned 2026-08-14)**: both sides now refuse startup on a
  set-but-malformed integer env value (Go always did; .NET's silent
  TryParse-fallback was replaced) so a typo'd knob can never run the two
  services at different effective configs.
